## PROJECT OVERVIEW

## ABSTRACT

    Contemporary anthropogenically induced ecosystem-level changes can alter nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) cycling and reduce biodiversity. We examined the effects of warming and N deposition on community composition and soil respiration in a temperate forest. We found that warming significantly increased CO2 flux on average. Plant species diversity did not differ significantly among treatements. Species richness was steady in control treatments but fluctuated in experimental scenarios. Our analysis indicates ecosystem disturbances do alter element cycling. We suggest that a longer-duration study is needed in order to observe significant effects on tree community dynamics, give their lengthy life histories.
    
## 1) INTRODUCTION

    Two of the most well-documented outcomes of anthropogenic global change are nitrogen deposition and climatic warming. These changes can alter C and N cycling in forests, and may favor certain species in plant and microbial communities, decreasing biodiversity and leading to species turnover. For example, there is evidence that N addition can reduce CO2 flux across numerous contexts (Bowden et al. 2004; Ramirez et al. 2012). It is known that N deposition can be related to changes in soil fungi community composition, but effects on bacterial communities are less evident (Hesse et al. 2015). Effects on tree communities associated with these microbes may be less facile to observe, given their slower rates of growth and turnover. Similarly, soil warming has been shown to increase soil respiration, while effects on microbial community composition are more ambiguous (Schindlbacher et al. 2011). There is ample research indicating physiological and phenological shifts in individual tree species under a warmed scenario (Xu et al. 2012; Zhao & Liu 2009). There is also evidence that particular species in a community can respond more or less favorably to such change, indicating that long-term warming could alter forest biodiversity (Arend et al. 2011; Thakur et al. 2014). In this analysis we evaluate primarily plant community and soil abiotic properties in a temperate forest. Abundances of 40 plant species were censused each year 2006 - 2009. Soil abiotic variables were measured ~monthly during this time. We used R to explore the effects of nitrogen and warming treatments on plant biodiversity and soil carbon dynamics over time.

**Research Question**: What are the short-term effects of soil warming plus N additions on plant richness and diversity at Harvard Forest?

> ***Hypothesis 1***: Richness and diversity will decrease over time in warming and N treatments.

> ***Hypothesis 2***: Soil repsiration will be higher in warmed plots, lower in N-amended plots.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```
## 3) DESCRIPTION OF DATA

The overall objective of this project is to investigate whether soil warming and N fertilization alter plant biodiversity through time (2006-2009). In 2006 a group at the Harvard Forest LTER led by Serita Frey, initiated an experiment to assess the interactive effects of these two environmental changes on plant, arthropod, and soil microbe community composition, and soil respiration (Frey 2009). Six replicate plots for each of four treatments (Control; N deposition; heated; N & heated interaction) were established. N deposition plots received 50 kg N/ha/yr. Heated plots were warmed to 5 degrees C above ambient temperature. The data for this project came from the Harvard Forest LTER site.

### B.Install Packages
This analysis will require several packages. The require() function in R returns TRUE if the package was successfully loaded or FALSE if the package failed to load. This for loop loads each package and installs the package when require() returns FALSE.

## 6)  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

  Rising temperatures and N deposition are occurring globally and can influence plant species composition through altered competition between neighboring species, increased environmental stress sensitivity, and changes in edaphic factors. Plant species richness and diversity have been shown to decline with increasing temperature and N deposition in a number of different ecosystems including: heathlands, grasslands, arctic tundra, and boreal and temperate forests (Strengbom et al. 2001; Gilliam and Roberts 2003; Clark and Tilman 2008; Southon et al. 2013). We found that soil warming and N fertilization did not influence plant diversity in the short term (2006-2009). However, average species richness differed among years and there was a significant year by nitrogen by warming interaction (P < 0.05). This interaction was likely driven by a significant decrease in richness in the warming x N treatment in 2008. Additionally, species turnover increased between 2007 and 2008 due to a greater number of species disappearances relative to appearances at that time. Abundances of the four most dominant species, comprising primarily understory plants, declined from 2006-2009, most notably in the warming treatments. These temporal shifts in richness and abundance may be related to changes in belowground dynamics and microbial community response to warming and N additions.    

  Soil respiration was significantly higher in warmed soils (P < 0.01). This finding is consistent with the results from a previous soil warming experiment conducted at Harvard Forest. In the short-term (first 12 years) rates of soil respiration were higher in heated plots compared to control plots (Melillo et al. 2002; DeAngelis et al. 2015). Increases in microbial activity and soil respiration can result in greater nutrient mineralization (Davidson et al. 2006). Furthermore, increases in soil nitrogen either from enhanced microbial activity or nitrogen fertilization can alter beneficial plant-microbial interactions (Classen et al. 2015). Once nitrogen is freely available, plants may invest less in relationships with symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi (Johnson et al. 2015). It has been demonstrated that warming and N fertilization can alter mycorrhizal community composition and abundance (Frey et al. 2004; Compant et al. 2013). Changes in plant-microbe interactions could influence plant performance and ultimately plant community composition (Classen et al. 2015).
